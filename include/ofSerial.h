	/// In some cases it may read less than 'length' bytes, so for reliable
	/// reading of >1 bytes of data the return value must be checked against the
	/// number of bytes requested, and if fewer bytes than requested were read
	/// then the call must be tried again.
	///
	/// This function should only be called when Serial.available() is reporting
	/// >0 bytes available.
	///
	/// An example of how to reliably read 8 bytes:
	/// ~~~~{.cpp}

	/// int bytesRequired = 8;
	/// unsigned char bytes[bytesRequired];
	/// int bytesRemaining = bytesRequired;

	///	 if ( serial.available() > 0 ){
	///		 // try to read - note offset into the bytes[] array, this is so
	///		 // that we don't overwrite the bytes we already have
	///		 int bytesArrayOffset = bytesRequired - bytesRemaining;
	///		 int result = serial.readData( &bytes[bytesArrayOffset], bytesRemaining );
	///
	///		 // check for error code
	///		 if ( result == OF_SERIAL_ERROR ){
	///			 // something bad happened

	///		 } else {

	///			 bytesRemaining -= result;
	///		 }
